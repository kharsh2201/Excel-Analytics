# Optimized Retail Delivery Operations Using Advanced Excel Analytics (October 2024 â€“November 2024)
### Overview:
Freshco Hypermarket, located in HSR Layout, Bangalore, initiated a data-driven analysis to evaluate the performance of its home delivery service, which launched in 2021. The aim was to optimize delivery operations, enhance customer experience, and extract strategic insights from the transactional and behavioral data recorded across various delivery slots, regions, and customer segments.

### Objective: The primary objective of this project was to:

Understand order distribution by time slot and geographic area
Evaluate the impact of discounts and delivery charges on order frequency
Assess completion and delivery rates across different dimensions
Analyze customer behavior through Lifetime Value (LTV), acquisition sources, and satisfaction ratings
Identify patterns in delivery time based on slot, day, and region

### Methodology:Data Preparation for Pivot Analysis:

- Cleaned data by removing duplicates and formatting date/time fields.
- Derived fields such as time slots, total value, delivery charges, and discount per product.
- Categorized delivery areas and acquisition sources for better grouping.
- Created pivot tables to analyze order trends, completion rates, LTV, and ratings.
- Used conditional formatting, filtering, and calculated columns to identify key trends.

### Key Findings:

Order Distribution and Growth Patterns:

The highest number of orders came from HSR Layout, followed by ITI Layout and Harlur.
Most orders were placed during the morning, afternoon, evening, and night slots, while late-night slots had the fewest orders. Cultural factors and additional night-time charges contributed to this trend.
A significant growth in order volume was noted in August and September, mainly due to an increase in discounts per product.

Completion Rate Performance:

The average order completion rate across all slots was 99.5%, with Kudlu (99.56%) and HSR Layout (99.54%) recording the highest rates.
Completion rate improved as the number of products per order increased, especially during the afternoon and evening slots.
Late-night orders consistently showed slightly lower completion rates, again likely due to external operational challenges.

Customer Insights:

Only 459 customers had a Lifetime Value (LTV) greater than the remaining 3,750 customers combined, highlighting a small but highly valuable customer base.
The organic and Google acquisition sources generated the highest LTVs, though channels like Facebook and offline campaigns showed higher average revenue per order despite lower LTV.
Over the months, LTV declined sharply, from 471 in January to just 2.8 in September, indicating either a drop in customer engagement or shorter customer lifecycles.

Customer Ratings:

Ratings improved with an increase in the number of products ordered.
Late-night slots received the lowest average rating (3.33), while morning (3.70) and afternoon (3.68) slots performed the best.

Delivery Time Analysis:

Average delivery time hovered around 30 minutes in key zones like Bellandur, Bommanahalli, Harlur, and HSR Layout.
Weekend deliveries took slightly longer than weekday deliveries.
Interestingly, late-night deliveries were quicker, possibly due to reduced traffic, countering their lower ratings.

### Conclusion:

The project revealed key operational strengths and weaknesses in Freshco's delivery model. It highlighted the significance of slot timing, geographic location, and discounting strategy on customer behavior and order success. The insights provided a roadmap for:
- Improving delivery efficiency in underperforming slots
- Investing in high-LTV customer acquisition channels
- Reevaluating promotional timing and discount structures
- Enhancing late-night delivery operations and customer satisfaction

### Impact:
This data-backed analysis empowered Freshco to make informed decisions to refine their delivery service, tailor their marketing efforts, and provide a more seamless customer experience. The outcomes have the potential to drive increased profitability and customer retention in the long term.
